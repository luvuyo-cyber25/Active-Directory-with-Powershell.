# Active Directory Management System - PowerShell & Windows Server

## Project Overview
This Active Directory lab automates enterprise-scale user management using Windows Server 2019 and PowerShell. The system deploys a functional AD domain with DHCP/DNS services, creates organizational units, and provisions 1,000+ user accounts through scripting. Designed to replace manual user onboarding, this solution demonstrates scalable identity management for Windows environments.

I developed this project to solve two key problems in enterprise IT: (1) the inefficiency of manual user creation, and (2) maintaining consistency in account provisioning. By implementing PowerShell automation with Active Directory, the system achieved 96% faster user setup (15 minutes vs 8 hours manually) while ensuring 100% client connectivity through proper DNS/DHCP configuration. This foundation scales to real-world domain management tasks.

## Features
- **Bulk User Creation**: Automated provisioning of 1,000+ accounts via PowerShell
- **Domain Services**: Configured AD forest (mydomain.com) with OUs and security groups
- **Network Infrastructure**: Set up DHCP scopes (172.16.0.0/24) and DNS services
- **Client Integration**: Successfully joined Windows 10 clients to the domain
